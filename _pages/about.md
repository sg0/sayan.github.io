I am a Computer Scientist in the Data Sciences group (a part of the Advanced Computing, Mathematics, and Data Division) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, WA. My research interests are broadly in the application of parallel programming models for HPC systems. Particularly, my interests are in using MPI one-sided communication (or Remote Memory Access) model for building scientific applications. At PNNL, I am contributing to the efforts of the ECP ExaGraph co-design center in developing efficient distributed-memory graph applications. I hold a Masters degree from University of Houston in Houston, TX and a PhD degree (both in Computer Sciences) from Washington State University in Pullman, WA.
