I am a Computer Scientist in the High Performance Computing (HPC) group of the Advanced Computing, Mathematics, and Data Division (ACMD) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/)) in [Richland, WA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richland,_Washington). I have a broad range of research interests in several aspects of HPC, such as, performance characterization \& analysis, proxy applications driven co-design, application of standardized parallel programming models (such as MPI and OpenMP) for building application kernels and development of one-sided/PGAS communication abstractions. Recently, I have been particularly interested in analyzing the systems aspect (such as communication or memory accesses) of various irregular graph application scenarios (such as clustering, triangle counting and matching) on HPC platforms. I am PI of a PNNL LDRD project on proxy applications driven co-design targeting heterogeneous systems ([PACER](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/dmc/converged-applications-projects)).

I hold a Masters degree from University of Houston in Houston, TX and a Ph.D. degree (both in Computer Sciences) from Washington State University in Pullman, WA.
