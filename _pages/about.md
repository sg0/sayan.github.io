I am currently a Computer Scientist in the Data Science and Machine Intelligence group (a part of the Advanced Computing, Mathematics, and Data Division) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, WA. My research interests are broadly in the development of high-level programming models, application of standardized parallel programming models (such as MPI and OpenMP) for building application kernels, performance modeling/analysis and proxy application driven co-design. I am an active contributor in the DOE ECP ExaGraph project, focusing on the development and analysis of graph applications on HPC systems. I am also PI of an LDRD project on proxy application driven codesign targeting heterogeneous systems.

I hold a Masters degree from University of Houston in Houston, TX and a PhD degree (both in Computer Sciences) from Washington State University in Pullman, WA.
