I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Washington State University in Pullman, WA. My research interests are broadly in parallel programming models targeting clusters and manycore systems. Particularly, my interests are in applying MPI one-sided communication (or Remote Memory Access) model in building scientific applications. During my Ph.D. studies, I spent over a year 
as an Alternate Sponsored Fellow at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, WA, contributing to the efforts of the ExaGraph co-design center in developing efficient distributed-memory graph applications. I hold a Masters degree in Computer Science from University of Houston in Houston, TX.
