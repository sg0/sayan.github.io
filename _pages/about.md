I am currently a Computer Scientist in the High Performance Computing group (a part of the Advanced Computing, Mathematics, and Data Division) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, WA. I have a range of research interests that are broadly in the development of communication abstractions, application of standardized parallel programming models (such as MPI and OpenMP) for building application kernels, performance characterization/analysis and proxy applications driven co-design. I am particularly interested in analyzing the systems aspect (such as communication or memory accesses) of various graph application scenarios (such as clustering, triangle counting and matching) on high-end systems. I am PI of a PNNL LDRD project on proxy applications driven co-design targeting heterogeneous systems.

I hold a Masters degree from University of Houston in Houston, TX and a PhD degree (both in Computer Sciences) from Washington State University in Pullman, WA.
