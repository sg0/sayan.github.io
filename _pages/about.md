I am a Computer Scientist in the Data Science and Machine Intelligence group (a part of the Advanced Computing, Mathematics, and Data Division) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, WA. My research interests are broadly in the application of parallel programming models for HPC systems. Particularly, my interests are in using distributed-memory programming models (such as MPI) for building scientific applications. At PNNL, I am actively contributing to multiple DOE ECP projects in development and analysis of graph applications on HPC systems. I am also a PI of an LDRD project on proxy application driven codesign targeting heterogeneous systems.  
I hold a Masters degree from University of Houston in Houston, TX and a PhD degree (both in Computer Sciences) from Washington State University in Pullman, WA.
