I am a fourth year Computer Science PhD candidate at Washington State University in Pullman, WA, and my adviser is Dr. Assefaw Gebremedhin. I am broadly interested in parallel programming models targeting clusters and manycore systems. Particularly, my interests are in applying MPI one-sided communication (or Remote Memory Access) model in building scientific applications. I am currently an intern at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, WA. I hold an MS degree in Computer Science from University of Houston in Houston, TX.
